# HealthChecksUpdate
Use HealthChecksUpdate.ps1 in your scripts to update your HealthChecks.io database from an agent computer. You can set up agents to check in periodically with the server to indicate they are still operational. HeathChecks uses a dead mans switch concept to ensure your list of vital computers and services are checking in and alive.
